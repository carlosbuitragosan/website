This project was created as part of an application for a developer's course with [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/).

It was intended to be a kind of CV and I attempted to do it as a one-page application that is fully responsive. 

I attempted to build a page that has no need to a menu bar, since there is little content that is visually separatd into 4 sections.
