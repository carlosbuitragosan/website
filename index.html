                    <p class="coding__answer coding__a1">I like being creative. I like art, design and technology, and I like the idea of being able to make web applications. I love learning new skills, and I believe I have potential to be a developer. </p>

                    <p class="coding__answer coding__a2">
                        I have been learning HTML, CSS and Javascript on my spare time. So far I cannot afford to pay for a course. A friend of mine who studied with Founders and Coders reccommended I learn with them. I like theire community-based approach and focus on social and environmental issues.

                        All this is completely new for me. It has been challenging trying to pick and choose my focus, as there are so many things to learn. I have found the online community and the meetups organised by Founders and Coders to be very helpful.

                        There should be no space for any form of discrimination in our community. We should contribute with our actions to help people feel safe, be able to express themselves in a respectful manner, and feel valued and appreciated.

                        Provided I have the knowledge I feel comfortable coaching, helping team members overcome obstacles. I am also a good observer and can offer a neutral perspective on issues that may arise within a team, and can offer help mending relationships associated with conflict.
